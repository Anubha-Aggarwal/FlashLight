It is a simple Torch application which can put on the Camera Flash and put it off. 
After 1 minute of continous use, the UI  prompts the user if he wants to keep using  the Torch.
If the user says Yes the Torch remains on for another minute and this cycle  repeats.
If the user says No, the Torch  puts off.
